# Discription:
*I have created a Number Game that is there are numbers from 1-100 code will generate random number between these within 10 trials. 
*We have to guess the number if guessed number is less than generated number then it will show number is less than the random number . 
*If guessed number is greater than generated number then it will tell the number is greater than generated number. 
*If guessed number is equal to the generated number program will print congratulation you have guessed right and stop execution. 
*It will also show you in how many trials you guessed right.
